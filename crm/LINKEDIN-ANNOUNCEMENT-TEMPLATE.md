### Option 1: Direct and Personal (Recommended)

```
I'm running something in December that I think some of you need.

It's called the Retention Reality Roundtable.

60 minutes. 8-10 managers from different companies. No slides, no pitch, just real conversation about what's actually happening on your teams.

Specifically, we're talking about the resignations that blindside you. The ones where you saw the signs but couldn't escalate without it becoming your problem. The pattern every manager sees but no one talks about outside their team.

This is for you if:
• You manage a team at a tech company (100-500 employees)
• Someone resigned in the last year and you didn't see it coming
• You've tried to escalate retention concerns and nothing changed
• You're tired of being surprised by departures and blamed when they happen

Not for HR professionals, consultants, or anyone looking to sell. Just managers dealing with this stuff.

What you'll leave with:
• Frameworks for spotting disengagement 60-90 days before resignation
• Language for escalating without getting blamed
• Tactics that actually work (not what HR recommends)

December 4, 12pm EST. Virtual. Free. 10 spots.

Application required because this only works if everyone in the room is dealing with real retention challenges.

Apply here: https://cloverera.com/roundtable/

I review every application personally. You'll hear back within 48 hours.

If you're a fit but the timing doesn't work, apply anyway. I'll notify you when the next one is scheduled.

### Option 2: Problem-Focused

```
Three things most managers won't say out loud:

1. They see the resignation coming 60-90 days before it happens
2. They try to escalate it and get blamed instead of supported
3. They've stopped raising concerns because nothing changes anyway

If this sounds familiar, I'm running something for you.

The Retention Reality Roundtable.
December 4. 12pm EST. 60 minutes. 10 managers. Real conversation.

No slides. No pitch. No HR-approved talking points.

Chatham House rules: Share what you learn, never who said it.

This is for managers at tech companies (100-500 employees) who are tired of:
• Being surprised by resignations they saw coming
• Escalating concerns that go nowhere
• Getting blamed for departures they warned about

What you'll walk away with:
• Early warning signals that show up before someone quits
• How to escalate without it becoming your problem
• What's actually working for other managers (usually not what HR suggests)

Free. Virtual. Application required.

Apply: https://cloverera.com/roundtable/

I review applications personally. Top 10 get in. If you're a fit but the timing doesn't work, I'll notify you about the next one.

### Option 3: Story-Led (More Personal)

```
A manager reached out last week.

"Someone on my team just gave notice. I saw it coming three months ago. Tried to escalate it. Leadership asked what I was doing wrong. Now he's gone and I'm being blamed for not keeping the team happy."

I've heard this exact story 47 times this year.

Different companies. Different industries. Same pattern.

That's why I'm running the Retention Reality Roundtable.

It's a 60-minute conversation for managers who are living this problem. Not a webinar. Not a pitch. Just 8-10 people from different companies talking about what's actually happening on their teams.

December 4, 12pm EST. Free. Virtual. 10 spots.

For managers at tech companies (100-500 employees) who:
• Have had someone resign and didn't see it coming
• See the warning signs but can't escalate without getting blamed
• Are tired of being surprised and held responsible

What we'll cover:
• The signals that show up 60-90 days before a resignation
• How to escalate without it becoming your fault
• What's working for other managers (not what HR recommends)

Chatham House rules: Share what you learn, never who said it.

Application required because this only works if everyone is dealing with real retention challenges. No consultants, no vendors, no HR professionals. Just managers.

Apply here: https://cloverera.com/roundtable/

I review every application personally within 48 hours.

If the timing doesn't work, apply anyway and I'll notify you about the next cohort.

### Option 4: Question Hook

```
When's the last time someone on your team gave notice and you genuinely didn't see it coming?

If the answer is "recently," you're not alone.

I've spent 20 years watching Fortune 500 companies obsess over operational efficiency while bleeding millions in turnover nobody was tracking.

The pattern I keep seeing: Managers see resignations coming. They try to escalate. Nothing changes. Then they get blamed when someone leaves.

So I'm running something about it.

The Retention Reality Roundtable.
December 4. 12pm EST. 60 minutes. 10 managers. Real conversation.

Not a webinar. No slides. No pitch.

Just managers from different companies talking about what's actually happening on their teams.

This is for you if:
• You manage a team at a tech company (100-500 employees)
• Someone resigned in the last year and surprised you
• You've escalated retention concerns and nothing changed
• You're tired of being blamed for departures you saw coming

What you'll leave with:
• Frameworks for spotting disengagement before it's too late
• Language for escalating without getting blamed
• Tactics that actually work (not what HR recommends)

Free. Virtual. 10 spots. Application required.

Apply: https://cloverera.com/roundtable/

I review every application personally. If you're a fit but the timing doesn't work, I'll add you to the list for the next one.

## Post Best Practices

### DO:
- Post between 8-10am EST on Wednesday, November 27
- Use your authentic voice (these are templates - edit to match your style)
- Engage with comments throughout the day
- Pin the post to your profile
- Share in relevant LinkedIn groups (if appropriate)
- Consider boosting post ($50-100 for targeted reach)

### DON'T:
- Use AI-sounding language like "I'd love to" or "feel free"
- Include too many hashtags (3-4 max)
- Make it sound like a sales pitch
- Oversell or make it sound "too good to be true"
- Forget to check spelling/links before posting

---

## Follow-Up Strategy

### If Post Gets Good Engagement:

**Day 2 (Nov 28):**
- Reply to all comments personally
- Share insights from comments in a follow-up comment

**Day 4 (Nov 30):**
- Post an update: "X managers have applied so far. Still a few spots open."
- Include screenshot of score distribution (without names)

**Day 6 (Dec 2):**
- Final reminder: "Registration closes today. 2 spots left."

### If Post Gets Low Engagement:

- Share to specific individuals via DM (managers you know who fit)
- Post in relevant groups
- Email your network directly
- Don't panic - you only need 10 applicants

---

## Responding to Comments

### Common Questions & Responses:

**Q: "Is this only for tech companies?"**
A: This cohort is focused on tech (100-500 employees) because the retention challenges are similar. If you're outside tech but dealing with the same patterns, apply anyway and mention it in your application.

**Q: "Will this be recorded?"**
A: Yes, shared with attendees only. Chatham House rules apply - share what you learn, never who said it.

**Q: "Can I bring my HR partner?"**
A: This one is just for managers. The conversation needs to be candid and that's harder when HR is in the room. No offense to HR folks - different audience.

**Q: "What if I can't make December 4?"**
A: Apply anyway. If you're a fit but the timing doesn't work, I'll add you to the list for the next cohort (likely Q1 2025).

**Q: "Is this free? What's the catch?"**
A: It's free. The value for me is meeting managers who are living this problem. Some will want to introduce these concepts to their CEO. Some won't. Either way, you'll leave with something useful.

**Q: "How many people have applied?"**
A: [Check your admin dashboard] I review applications as they come in. Looking for managers at the right company size who are dealing with real retention challenges.

## DM Template (For Direct Outreach)

If you want to personally invite specific managers:

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your recent post about [retention challenge they mentioned].

I'm running a roundtable on December 4 about exactly this - managers talking about what's actually happening with retention on their teams. No pitch, just real conversation.

Thought of you because [specific reason based on their content].

Details here if you're interested: https://cloverera.com/roundtable/

Either way, hope things improve on your team.

## Analytics to Track

After posting, monitor:

- **Post views:** How many people saw it
- **Engagement rate:** Likes, comments, shares
- **Click-through rate:** Post views → roundtable page visits
- **Application rate:** Roundtable page visits → applications
- **Conversion rate:** Applications → accepted

**Expected funnel:**
- 10,000 impressions → 500 page visits → 20 applications → 10 accepted

If numbers are significantly lower, adjust follow-up strategy.

---

## Alternative Channels

If LinkedIn doesn't generate enough applications:

1. **Email Newsletter** (if you have one)
2. **Manager Slack Groups** (if you're in any)
3. **Twitter/X** (adapt post for shorter format)
4. **Partner Networks** (ask partners to share)
5. **Direct Outreach** (DM managers who fit profile)

---

## After Posting

1. **Monitor applications in admin dashboard**
2. **Review within 48 hours** (as promised)
3. **Accept top 10 based on score + fit**
4. **Respond to all comments on LinkedIn**
5. **Follow up with waitlisted applicants**
