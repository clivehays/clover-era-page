  assumption_heading: 'The Problem',
  assumption_text: 'A team of eight people responsible for operations in a healthcare environment was struggling with team dynamics. They couldn\'t find a cohesive way of working together. Productivity was suffering. Communication had broken down. The team lead knew something was wrong but couldn\'t pinpoint what.<br><br>They brought in Clive Hays for direct one-on-one coaching with each team member. Alongside the coaching, Clover ERA was implemented to provide immediate visibility into what was happening across the team and to guide the ongoing work once the coaching engagement ended.',

  surfaced_heading: 'What CLOVER Surfaced',
  surfaced_text: 'Within two weeks, the system flagged four dimensions.<br><br>Communication scored 31%. The team wasn\'t communicating effectively. Information wasn\'t flowing. People weren\'t clear on what others were working on or why decisions were being made.<br><br>Reflection scored 34%. Nobody was stepping back to assess how things were going. Problems that were obvious to everyone individually had never been surfaced collectively.<br><br>Opportunity scored 43%. People couldn\'t see a path forward. In a small team within a large healthcare organization, career progression felt invisible.<br><br>Vulnerability scored 52%. People weren\'t being honest with each other. The psychological safety needed for real collaboration wasn\'t there.',

  leader_quote: 'The one-on-one coaching confirmed exactly what the CLOVER data was showing. The system surfaced in two weeks what would typically take months of observation and conversation to diagnose.',
  leader_attribution: null,

  intervention_heading: 'What Changed',
  intervention_text: 'This was a hybrid engagement. Direct one-on-one coaching with each team member combined with Clover ERA providing the data, the actions, and the ongoing measurement.<br><br>The bi-weekly CLOVER reports guided the coaching conversations. The Action Hub gave the team lead and the team specific steps to implement between sessions. The coaching brought depth and accountability. The platform brought visibility and continuity.<br><br>Every two weeks, the scores updated. Every two weeks, the team could see their own progress. The combination of human coaching and system-driven actions created a feedback loop that accelerated the transformation.',

  headline_result: 'The results were so visible to upper management that they requested the same process be applied to their C-suite. The team didn\'t upsell. The outcomes did.',

  proves_heading: 'Why the Hybrid Model Works',
  proves_points: [
    'CLOVER provides the diagnosis. In two weeks, the system surfaced four specific dimensions that needed work. Without the data, coaching relies on observation alone.',
    'Coaching provides the depth. One-on-one conversations bring accountability, nuance, and trust that a platform cannot replicate.',
    'Together, they compound. The platform guides the coaching. The coaching activates the platform\'s recommendations. The team sees their own scores improving in real time, which builds momentum and belief.',

  proves2_heading: 'What This Proves For Teams of Any Size',
  proves2_points: [
    'CLOVER works at the smallest scale. Eight people. One team. The same system that serves 350 people in a Fortune 500 division works for a single team in healthcare.',
    'The hybrid approach of coaching plus platform creates the fastest transformation. 46% to 76% in 10 weeks.',
    'When results are visible, expansion is organic. Upper management didn\'t need to be sold. They saw the change and asked for it.',
