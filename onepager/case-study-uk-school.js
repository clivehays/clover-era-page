  page2_header: 'The Intervention and Results',

  assumption_heading: 'The Assumption',
  assumption_text: 'A large private school in the United Kingdom with 300 staff members believed their people were well supported. They ran professional development sessions at the end of each academic term. The schedule existed. The investment was there. Leadership assumed it was working.',

  surfaced_heading: 'What CLOVER Surfaced',
  surfaced_text: 'Within two weeks of launching Clover ERA, the dashboard flagged Learning as the dimension that needed the most attention. In an organisation that exists to teach, the staff themselves had no meaningful path to develop their own skills.<br><br>The Learning dimension scored 29%. The lowest in the school.<br><br>Communication surfaced alongside it, which is common. When people don\'t feel they\'re growing, they also stop talking about it.<br><br>The termly development sessions were the problem, not the solution. Staff were arriving with no preparation, no direction, and no sense that the sessions would lead anywhere. As one staff member described it: the sessions existed on the calendar but not in anyone\'s development.',

  leader_quote: 'He was amazed that learning surfaced as their lowest area. He found it enlightening because he was now able to help his staff in a way he couldn\'t before.',
  leader_attribution: 'Head Teacher',

  intervention_heading: 'What Changed',
  intervention_text: 'Leadership didn\'t hire consultants. They didn\'t buy another platform. They made one structural change: 30 minutes per week allocated for every staff member to focus on something they wanted to improve. Self-directed. Personal.<br><br>Those 30 minutes became preparation for the termly sessions. Staff arrived with content, questions, and context. The sessions that had been dismissed as useless became the most valuable days on the calendar.',

  headline_result: 'The intervention cost nothing. The insight that triggered it came from Clover ERA.',

  metrics: [
    { label: 'Overall CLOVER Score', before: '45%', after: '66%', context: 'in 3 months' },

    { label: 'Time to First Insight', before: '', after: '2 weeks', context: 'from launch to action' },

  metrics_footnote: 'Both dimensions have continued to improve in subsequent months.',

  user_quote: 'I just love the way I now get 30 seconds a day to reflect on my workday, what\'s working and what\'s not.',
  user_attribution: 'Staff Member',

  proves_heading: 'What This Proves',
  proves_points: [
    'CLOVER surfaces blind spots leadership didn\'t know existed, even in areas they assumed were strengths.',
    'The most effective interventions are often structural and cost nothing. They just need the right data to trigger them.',
    'Two weeks from launch to insight. Three months from insight to measurable transformation.',
