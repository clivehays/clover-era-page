        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Look, I'm not a workplace strategist. I don't have a PhD in neuroscience or a best-selling book about employee engagement.</p>
<p>I'm his daughter. That's how I got the spreadsheet.<br>That's why I'm here.</p>
<p>But I've also been in it. Fully fried. Treading water. Crying because Outlook sent a follow-up reminder at 8:07am.</p>
<p>So when someone said, "can you turn this into a blog post?"<br>&hellip;I did.</p>
<p>What follows isn't professional advice. It's just what burnout actually feels like when you're inside it.<br>No filters. No fake optimism. Just printers, despair, and a very normal meeting called "Quick Sync."</p>
<h2>The Printer Jam That Broke Me</h2>
<p>There's a very specific flavour of despair that hits when the printer jams on a Monday morning and you realise &mdash; very calmly, very clinically &mdash; that this might be the thing that finally ends you.</p>
<p>Not a trauma. Not a breakup.<br>Just paper. Paper and an error message.</p>
<p>That's how it starts.</p>
<p>Not with an explosion, but with tiny malfunctions.<br>Forgetting what day it is.<br>Crying because your inbox says "follow-up."<br>Thinking about quitting your job while brushing your teeth &mdash; and forgetting halfway through the thought because you're already late for a meeting titled "Quick Sync."</p>
<p>This is burnout.<br>Or what used to be called burnout.</p>
<p>Now they're calling it&nbsp;<span class="highlight-quote">The Great Detachment</span>, which sounds like either a sci-fi film or a gentle cult.<br>It's neither.<br>It's just the slow erosion of anything that used to tether you to meaning.</p>
<div class="stats-box">
<h3>Apparently:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Burnout mentions on Glassdoor are up 32% this year &mdash; the highest since 2016.</li>
<li>79% of employees are still in their jobs, but emotionally checked out.</li>
<li>Weekend work is normal. Late-night meetings are up.</li>
<li>And most people say they'd trade a raise for the chance to just breathe.</li>
</ul>
<p>(And no, I didn't know any of that until my dad gave me a spreadsheet and said, "Can you turn this into a blog post?" Which is how we got here.)</p>
</div>
<h2>I Couldn't Write the Neat Version</h2>
<p>I wanted to make this neat.<br>I really did.</p>
<p>There was going to be a title. A hook. A point. Possibly an infographic.<br>You were going to scroll through and go, "ah yes, that's insightful."<br>And then you were going to return to your job and immediately pretend everything was fine.</p>
<p>But I couldn't write that version.<br>Because I am absolutely not fine.</p>
<p>I don't mean that in a dramatic, melt-down-on-a-desk sort of way.<br>I mean that in a quiet, dry-cereal-for-dinner, eye-twitching-in-meetings, "do I even do anything?" kind of way.</p>
<p>It's not tiredness.<br>It's not laziness.<br>It's not a productivity issue.<br>It's something else. Something deeper and flatter. Like my nervous system got unplugged and someone's too afraid to tell me.</p>
<h2>You're Not Alone in This</h2>
<p>And I know it's not just me.<br>Because people keep saying things like:</p>
<p>"I just need a proper break."<br>"Things are busy right now."<br>"I'm fine, just tired."</p>
<p>But we've been saying that for three years straight.</p>
<p>And we've all got that look in our eyes now &mdash; the one you get when you're still technically moving, but only because inertia hasn't given up yet.</p>
<h2>This Isn't a Blog Post</h2>
<p>So no &mdash; this isn't a blog post.<br>This is a slightly feral, unofficial message from someone who was supposed to write something helpful and ended up whisper-screaming into the CMS instead.</p>
<p>If you're also on your last nerve but still answering emails with "no worries at all!"<br>If your personality has started buffering mid-sentence.<br>If your brain left the building and no one noticed:</p>
<p><strong>You're not alone.<br>You're just very, very done.</strong></p>
<p>And somehow, still showing up.<br>Which honestly? Might be the most heroic thing any of us are doing right now.</p>
<h3>PS: Why am I writing this on the Clover Era blog?</h3>
<p>Because that's kind of the whole point.</p>
<p>Clover exists because this isn't sustainable.<br>Because people are burning out, disconnecting, ghosting their own potential &mdash; and everyone's still pretending it's fine.</p>
<p>We're not here to sell solutions with smiley graphs. We're here because someone had to say it out loud.</p>
<p><strong>You're not imagining it.<br>It really is this hard.<br>And if you're still standing &mdash; even just barely &mdash; then we built this for you.</strong></p>
